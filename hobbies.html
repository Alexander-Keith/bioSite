        Nathan Chandler Keith is my big brother (11 years older than me), so I am familiar with most of his personal information and hobbies. We play video games together when he has time, he tried and failed a few times to teach me how to play golf, and we both enjoy working on cars. I know basically nothing about networking and servers, so I am relying on explanations and a bit of googling to understand exactly what he was talking about in his certification list. He has been working in the networking career field for a long time. I started by asking my brother if he would be ok with me using him for this project, then we started talking about the required information over Discord. Next, he sent me a link to a google photos page that he created for me to pull photos from to use for the project. He uploaded several pictures to the site, and we discussed what was good and which pictures could be replaced with a better version if available. Picking the right family pictures is always important. Next, we went over his job experience, and for this he sent me a link to his LinkedIn page. Nathan is entirely self taught, so he does not have any official certifications. We decided to break out his experience by following a company, job position title, and work experience gained. The LinkedIn page was the best resource combined with explanations on Discord of what all the things listed were.
